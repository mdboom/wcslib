TODO (needs to be categorized and ordered properly):

* In tcel2, some of the graticules are missing their parallels of latitude.

* Mac OS X 10.5.7 malloc problems - August Muench, 2009/07/07.

* Change test suite to report summary "PASS" / "FAIL" at the end where
  possible.

* Change Fortran/test/ttab2.f to match C/test/ttab2.c.

* Define macros with informative names for status return values.  E.g.
  status == 1 from wcs.c functions would be #define WCS_NULLPTR 1.

* New "fixer" function to translate non-standard longitude/latitude pairs,
  e.g. "LONG"/"NPOL" -> xLON/xLAT or yzLN/yzLT (Pan Chai email, 2008/02/26).

* wcsbth
  + Create a more complicated test header for testing.

* CUBEFACE and STOKES handling in wcshdo().

* wcsbth
  + Implement bintable cross-references:
    WCSXna -> WCSTna, e.g. WCSX13A -> WCST12B (fully specified)
  + Flag axis or column numbers with leading 0, e.g. 0CRPX03?

* Write a C++ test program.

* Fix gaps in pgtest CYP grid lines at +/-180.

* Interface to SoFA for changing Doppler frames and coordinate systems.



Autoconf
--------
* Define macros for BEGIN_C_DECLS and END_C_DECLS (for C++) and use them in
  the headers (autoconf book, Sect. 7.1.3).

* Function definitions (autoconf book, Sect. 7.1.4).


General
-------
* Verify and distribute the FITS test file generated by twcstab.

* Create and distribute FITS test files for spectral coordinates.


C library
---------

* Augment twcstab.c with an optional coordinate grid plot.

* Check the range of validity of the refraction equations when computing
  AWAV.

* Implement VELANGLa from Paper III - requires changes to the interfaces
  of some spc and spx functions.  Also how to handle multiple roots?

* Function to convert coordinate systems, e.g. FK5 to ICRS (Neil).

* FITS WCS verifier (Bill Pence, email 2004/12/17).

* Investigate the possibility of allowing output arrays to be set to input
  arrays, e.g. prjs2x(prj, nx, ny, sxy, sxy, x, y, x, y, stat).

* Investigate the speed of the wcstrig wrappers (Emmanuel Bertin, email)
  versus the macro implementation.

* Implement Paper IV.


PGSBOX
------
* Generalise pgwcsl to 2-D slices of an N-D image, e.g. an RA-Vel slice
  through an RA-Dec-Vel cube.


Low priority
------------
* Fix wcsmix() polar case.

* Routine returning, for any projection, the sky solid angle subtended by a
  pixel (Patrick Sizun, email 2005-01-04; Jürgen Knödlseder, email
  2009-02-23).

* Routine returning, for any projection, the value of the Jacobian at any
  point.


WCSLIB
------
* Deal with r0 < 0.

* cutfwd() & cutrev(): given a path defined by a (possibly parameterized)
  function of pixel coordinates (for example, a slice) cutfwd() accepts either
  longitude or latitude and returns the pixel coordinates, cutrev() accepts
  one or other element of the pixel coordinate and returns the longitude and
  latitude.

* C++ wrapper classes.


PGSBOX
------
* pgsbox/pgwcsl doesn't properly handle the divergence of Mercator's
  projection.

* pgwcls doesn't handle discontinuities between the faces of the quadcube
  projections - the native longitude doesn't jump in passing between faces.

* pgsbox/pgwcsl can't handle pixels which lie outside the principle range
  of native longitude [-180,180].  There doesn't appear to be much hope of
  handling this.
